# Hangman

### How to play:

Hangman is an old-school favorite, a word game where the goal
is to find the missing word.
<br /> You will be presented with several blank spaces representing
the missing letters you need to find.
<br />
Click on the letters to guess if the letter is in the word.
<br /> If your chosen letter exists in the answer, then all places
where that letter appears will be revealed.
<br /> After you've revealed several letters, you may be able to guess
what the answer is and fill in the remaining letters.
<br /> Be warned, whenever you guess a letter wrong, you lose a life,
and the hangman begins to appear, piece by piece.
<br /> Solve the puzzle before the hangman dies.
